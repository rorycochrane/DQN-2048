# 2048 Deep Q Network (Pytorch)
Implementation of a Convolutional Deep Q Network to play the game 2048 using Pytorch.

## Project Description
This project implements a Deep Q Network (DQN) model trained to play the popular game 2048. The model was developed in Pytorch, and it uses reinforcement learning to optimize gameplay strategy by learning from actions and rewards.

The structure of the neural net was the result of some experimentation, and seems to perform reasonably well, while still being able to run on a Laptop.
